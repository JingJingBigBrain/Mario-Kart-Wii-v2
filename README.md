# Mario-Kart-Wii-v2
Hey guys! It's JingJing here, this project includes 32 custom tracks instead of all the original Wii Nitro and Retro tracks. This project is still in beta, so there might be some bugs! ⚠️USE AT YOUR OWN RISK⚠️ 

# Project Information
This is a free, open source project. I mean all the Wii Game Files are open source, because you can extract them and all the files are in the DATA folder. All the custom tracks used in this game mod could be downloaded.

If you think the download link I provided is an affiliate link or AD link, it's probably because you never saw this server before. I use Gofile because it has unlimited storage and unlimited download and upload speed. If it ask you "Are you protected with a VPN ?", select "I have a VPN already".

# IF YOU SPEND MONEY ON THIS ROM, ASK YOUR MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY!!!
